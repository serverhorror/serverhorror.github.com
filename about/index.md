**Starting from <date time="{{ '2014-07-01' | date_to_xmlschema }}">
1<sup>st</sup> of July 2014</date> I will be available for contract work.  Feel
free to contact me with any interesting projects.**

Since <date time="{{ '2013-06-01' | date_to_xmlschema }}">June 2013</date> I am <em>Head
of Monetarization Technologies Operations</em> leading a team of 12 persons.

As of 2011-04 I started to work for [1&1 Internet AG](http://www.1und1.de/) as
System Administrator and so call <em><abbr title="Operations Manger
IT">OMIT</abbr></em>.  Since this a new job I won't post any details on what I do.
Maybe later, if I have more confidence that I'm not publishing confidential
information, and even more important if I get clearance on that stuff.
