For better or worse I'm running a [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) exit node now on one of my publicly facing servers.

I'll see how it goes and wether it is indeed such a hassle to run something like this. If I find the time I'll probably publish a page with traffic stats and possibly even abuse complaints that come in - just for the fun of it.
