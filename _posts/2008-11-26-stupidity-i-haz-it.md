{% highlight irc %}
14:11:53 <me> hmm i have this: "[(elem1, elem2), (elem3, elem4), ...]" what I'd like would be to make that a dictionairy where the first element of each tuple becomes the key and the second element the value. any easy magic that does something like that?
14:12:36 <other> me: dict(L)
{% endhighlight %}
Shame on me!
