<p>Yes <em>ekimus</em> is my nickname in that case...<code>
<strong><em>14:11:53</em> <ekimus&gt;</strong> hmm i have this: "[(elem1, elem2), (elem3, elem4), ...]" what I'd like would be to make that a dictionairy where the first element of each tuple becomes the key and the second element the value. any easy magic that does something like that?
<strong><em>14:12:36</em> <eggy_&gt;</strong> ekimus: dict(L)
