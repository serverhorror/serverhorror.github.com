My personal µ-awk tutorial, just some notes I like **not to forget**...

Print the average of a column:
[sourcecode langauage="text"]
# grep daemon_with_interesting_column_eight daemon.log | awk '{sum+=$8} END { print "Average = ",sum/NR}'
[/sourcecode]
Print the average of a column fullfilling a constraint:
[sourcecode langauage="text"]
# awk '/$8>=0.02/  {sum+=$8} END { print "Average = ",sum/NR}'
[/sourcecode]
