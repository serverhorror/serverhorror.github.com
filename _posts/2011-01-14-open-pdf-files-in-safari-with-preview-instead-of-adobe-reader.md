<p>I recently installed Adobe Reader to have it available on my OS X (Snow Leopard) installation.</p>
<p>From that point on Safari insisted on opening PDF files in the browser with Adobe Reader instead of Preview.app.</p>
<ol>
<li>Changing the way PDF files are opened in Finder didn't help</li>
<li>Scanning Safari Preferences didn't help</li>
<li>Scanning Adobe Prefences revealed an option but I wasn't able to uncheck it. ("Preferences" -&gt; "Internet" -&gt; "Display PDF in browser using:" - in case you are searching</li>
</ol>
<p>To "switch back" delete (or move) the file "/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/AdobePDFViewer.plugin". The resulting preferences from Adobe Reader are shown below. Also now you have Preview.app back in Safari when opening PDF files.</p>

If you need Safari to open PDF files with Adobe Reader again just move "AdobePDFViewer.plugin" back toÂ "/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/" and restart Safari. The same approach should work if you move it to "~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/" - though I haven't tested that and right now I am too lazy to do that...</p>
