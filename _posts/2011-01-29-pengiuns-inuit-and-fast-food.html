<p>Dear Lazyweb:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do Iniut eat PenguinMcNuggetswhen they go to McDonalds?</li>
<li>Do Iniut eat Inuit eat Penguin Wings when they go to Kentucky Fried Chicken?</li>
<li>And why does Kentucky Fried Chicken even exist outside of Kentucky?</li>
</ul>
<p>No pun intended, I just caught myself being reminded how McDonalds, KFC and alike "localize" their products. I wonder to what extend they really do it...</p>
