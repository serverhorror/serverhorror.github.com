<p>It seems the Kernel Maintainers of the IDE-subsystem are "giving up". A recent thread thread on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) fired up a discussion about the IDE-subsystem. The discussion arised because the former maintainer Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz made a few changes to the subsystem and a user of a SPARC system reported undesired behaviour.</p>
<p>Zolnierkiewicz mentioned being quite tired about the "hostile environment" (<em>I'm really tired of this kind of hostility towards IDE changes[...]</em>) he feels to be in, so he suggested to David Miller to take over maintainership of the subsystem who immediately accepted.</p>
<p>However David Milleralso noted that he will tread the IDE-subsystem as a pure legacy (<em>I'm going to treat IDE as pure legacy [...]</em>). Linus Torvalds also took part in the discussion and told Miller and Zolnierkiewicz to invest more time in the subsystem to iron out the problems it has.</p>
<p>Here are some links to key points in the discussion (hosted on gmane):</p>
