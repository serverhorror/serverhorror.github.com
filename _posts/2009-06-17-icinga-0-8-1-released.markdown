It [seems the people who forked Nagios](http://www.icinga.org/team/) are making progress fast. The [initial 0.8.0 release of Icinga](http://www.icinga.org/2009/05/20/icinga-v080-is-out/) wasn't too long ago and already [Icinga 0.8.1 has been released](http://www.icinga.org/2009/06/17/icinga-081-released/). I hope they keep up the good work and prepackaged binaries for the larger distributions will show up fairly soon.
