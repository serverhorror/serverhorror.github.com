[Firefox 3.5 is ready](ftp://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.5/) for download. The [official Press Release is still missing](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/comingsoon/). But I found some reports that it's already possible to download the new Firefox 3.5

Probably the most interesting changes are:



	
  * HTML5 support and

	
  * native support of Ogg-Vorbis andÂ Ogg-Theora


That means that you are now able to watch videos (as hopefully some video portals will soon change, and I read reports that some already did) without any 3rd party plugins or extensions. Right now the download doesn't have a link but you can:

	
  * **[browse it here to get it now via FTP](ftp://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.5/) or**

	
  * **use [this link to directly download via http](http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-3.5&os=linux&lang=en-US)**
