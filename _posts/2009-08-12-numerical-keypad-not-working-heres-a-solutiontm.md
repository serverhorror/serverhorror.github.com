<p>So i run Debian/Unstable on my workstation. It works fine 99% percent of the time but recently the numerical keypad stopped working. I have no idea what caused it but somehow the keyboard settings from Gnome have been modified.</p>
<p>The problem was that under "<em>System</em>" -> "<em>Preferences</em>" - > "<em>Keyboard</em>" under the "<em>Mouse Keys</em>" tab there's an option "<em>Pointer can be controlled using the keypad</em>". This option was checked.</p>
<p>Took me quite a while to figure this out but now I can happily type my numbers on the keypad again.</p>
<p>Here's the screenshot (mostly for my own reference) where to find the option:</p>
