<p>Today I got myself a cheap printer.</p>
<p>It's a Lexmark INTERPRET s405. I was looking for the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wireless Printing</li>
<li>Wireless Scanning</li>
<li>Optionally Wireless Fax</li>
<li>Cheap</li>
</ol>
<p>The thing was EUR 99,--. That's probably the lower end of multi-function devices - price wise. But I don't see a reason why I can't just enter the ESSID and password from my wireless LAN to set it up. Instead I had to use this:</p>
<p><a href="http://serverhorror.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/wireless-installation-cable.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-916" title="Wireless Installation Cable" src="http://serverhorror.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/wireless-installation-cable.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear people from Lexmark!</p>
<p>Please, please, please, just let me enter my ESSID and Password directly at the printer. Wouldn't that be so much easier? Wouldn't that save you a ton of money in the long run? You wouldn't have to add an USB cable to every printer.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>A Customer</p></blockquote>
