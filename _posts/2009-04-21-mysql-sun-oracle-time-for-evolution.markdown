No I'm not going to advertise that [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) can only get better because [Sun](http://www.sun.com) bought it and now has in turn been bought by [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com).

It is true that MySQL can only get better but the reasons for this are that there for example is:



	
  * no way to do a consistent backup

	
  * schema changes aren't transactional

	
  * it doesn't scale very well


There couldn't be a better time for [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org). It's completely community driven (released under a [BSD-License](http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence)). That means



	
  * YOU are defining which features get into it at which don't.

	
  * it can't be bought by a company that suddenly shuts it down

	
  * If you want to you can patch [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) to your liking and don't give away the source code (not necessarily a good thing, but you have the freedom to do so)


To be fair MySQL couldn't be shut down down either, but Oracle could just stop releasing a database that is called MySQL and all of a sudden you may find yourself in the situation that you have to choose between PerconaSQL or whatnot.

Not so with [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org). You get [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) which is IMHO superior to all other Open-Source Databases out there, in fact I think it's actually the only Open-Source [RDBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) system left.

[Go get PostgreSQL!](http://www.postgresql.org)
