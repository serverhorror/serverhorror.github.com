The nice people over at wordnik actually used [my code](http://github.com/serverhorror/python-wordnik) for [their example libraries](http://blog.wordnik.com/ruby-and-python-libraries-rails-and-django-demo-apps). A nice thing to hear, never occured to me that my random scripting I put on [GitHub](http://github.com) is actually really useful to other people. I guess that is what Open Source is actually about :)
