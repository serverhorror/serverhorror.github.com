<div style="text-align:right;"></div>
<div style="text-align:center;">The introduction at <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker.com </a>seems nice except for: <span style="font-weight:bold;">It just doesn't work!</p>
<p></span><a href="http://www.taskfive.com/"><img style="cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:214px;" src="http://serverhorror.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/taskfivewentwrong.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align:left;">I'm not saying <a href="http://www.taskfive.com/">TaskFive </a>isn't working at all. I could register and even got an invitation email to a second email account since I couldn't figure out wether I was supposed to register as a mentor or a company account.<br />
I do like the idea of the simple task list. Maybe I'll check back sometime...</div>
