<p>SourceForge.net opened the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/">votes for the Community Choice Awards</a>. You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/?f=485">vote for Nagios (direct voting)</a>, but not for <a href="http://www.icinga.org">Icinga</a>. Too bad, especially as Nagios is a well established project and <a href="http://www.icinga.org/why-a-fork/">Icinga being rather new</a> could need some attention.</p>
<p>I couldn't find Icinga in the list, if you now the link to vote for Icinga I'd be happy about it, just drop a comment (if anybody is indeed reading this blog).</p>
