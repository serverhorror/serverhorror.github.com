<p>I just checked my Google Reader's starred items and found I have roughly 180 posts starred. Usually I do this when I have the feeling of (multiple choices possible):</p>
<ul>
<li>I should try that (as in invest 2-3 hours)</li>
<li>Seems wrong</li>
<li>Great stuff, interesting topic to investigate (as in a couple of days - weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I would indeed write about one item per day I'm full for half a year. I wonder if somebody already coined "blog bankrupcy".</p>
