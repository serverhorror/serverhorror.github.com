<p>The nice people over at wordnik actually used <a href="http://github.com/serverhorror/python-wordnik">my code</a> for <a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/ruby-and-python-libraries-rails-and-django-demo-apps">their example libraries</a>. A nice thing to hear, never occured to me that my random scripting I put on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is actually really useful to other people. I guess that is what Open Source is actually about :)</p>
