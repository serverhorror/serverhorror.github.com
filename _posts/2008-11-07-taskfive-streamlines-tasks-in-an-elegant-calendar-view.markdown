The introduction at [lifehacker.com ](http://lifehacker.com/)seems nice except for: It just doesn't work!

I'm not saying [TaskFive ](http://www.taskfive.com/)isn't working at all. I could register and even got an invitation email to a second email account since I couldn't figure out wether I was supposed to register as a mentor or a company account.
I do like the idea of the simple task list. Maybe I'll check back sometime...
