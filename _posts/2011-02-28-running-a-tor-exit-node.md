<p>For better or worse I'm running a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> exit node now on one of my publicly facing servers.</p>
<p>I'll see how it goes and wether it is indeed such a hassle to run something like this. If I find the time I'll probably publish a page with traffic stats and possibly even abuse complaints that come in - just for the fun of it.</p>
