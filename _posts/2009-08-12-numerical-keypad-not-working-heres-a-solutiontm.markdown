title: Numerical Keypad not Working? - Here's a Solution(TM)

So i run Debian/Unstable on my workstation. It works fine 99% percent of the time but recently the numerical keypad stopped working. I have no idea what caused it but somehow the keyboard settings from Gnome have been modified.

The problem was that under "_System_" -> "_Preferences_" - > "_Keyboard_" under the "_Mouse Keys_" tab there's an option "_Pointer can be controlled using the keypad_". This option was checked.

Took me quite a while to figure this out but now I can happily type my numbers on the keypad again.

Here's the screenshot (mostly for my own reference) where to find the option:
