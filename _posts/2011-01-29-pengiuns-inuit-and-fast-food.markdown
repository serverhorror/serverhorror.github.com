Dear Lazyweb:



	
  * Do Iniut eat PenguinMcNuggetswhen they go to McDonalds?

	
  * Do Iniut eat Inuit eat Penguin Wings when they go to Kentucky Fried Chicken?

	
  * And why does Kentucky Fried Chicken even exist outside of Kentucky?


No pun intended, I just caught myself being reminded how McDonalds, KFC and alike "localize" their products. I wonder to what extend they really do it...
