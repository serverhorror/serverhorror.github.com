Regarding my [previous post about NILFS2](http://serverhorror.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/howto-nilfs2/), I just found two nice blog posts over at [opensourcetips.org](http://opensourcetips.org) that also explain a bit more about possible use cases and how NILFS2 works:

The first post is more or less a basic feature enumeration but for starters it provides quite a nice overview, while the second posts dives a bit into the details, I'f you never worked with NILFS2 before - or any other log-based-filesystem for that matter - I recommend having a short read on both of them. It's actually just a few minutes to invest but you get some nice overview and hopefully some ideas what's possible with this new filesystem.
