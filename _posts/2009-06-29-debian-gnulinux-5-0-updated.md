<p>2 days ago the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian Project</a> (the distribution which Ubuntu is based on) updated it current stable release (5.0 - Lenny). Among a <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2009/20090627"><em>New version of the debian-installer</em></a> there are also a remarkable number of security fixes for this major update - not that the nice people from the <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/">Debian Security Team</a> haven't updated their distribution until yet - but the <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2009/20090627">number of 57 bug fixes</a> (as the press release states) is just another sign that - yes - open-source also software has security issues. But at least they (a) tell you about it and evenly important (b) they do fix issues in a very strict time frame.</p>
<p>An especially nice point is that if you incorporate the <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/">upgrades from security.debian.org</a> in your sources list on a regular basis you won't even have to download vast amounts of data since the majority of the security upgrades should already be fixed for you.<em>
