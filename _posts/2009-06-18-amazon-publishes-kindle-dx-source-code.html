<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com">Amazon</a> yesterday <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/want-the-kindle-source-code-you-can-have-it/">published the source code</a> of the Kindle DX. They have until now released three Kindle products.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Original_Kindle">Kindle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_2">Kindle 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_DX">Kindle DX</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Over at <a href="http://www.blogkindle.com/">blogkindle.com</a> is a post covering some <a href="http://www.blogkindle.com/2007/12/kindle-source-code/">details about the original source code</a>, but it seems that there hasn't been an update yet about the new Kindle DX source code. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200203720">grab the source code for Kindle DX here</a>. The page also lists the source code for the earlier product versions of the Kindle, so it may still be usefull to you even if you do not own a Kindle DX.</p>
<p>However the source code isn't the full code used in the Kindle DX (the same is true for the other downloads), it might still be interesting to skim over it or investigate the toolchain they used to provide the functionality of the Kindle DX.</p>
