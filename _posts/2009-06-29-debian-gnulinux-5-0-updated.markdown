2 days ago the [Debian Project](http://www.debian.org) (the distribution which Ubuntu is based on) updated it current stable release (5.0 - Lenny). Among a [_New version of the debian-installer_](http://www.debian.org/News/2009/20090627) there are also a remarkable number of security fixes for this major update - not that the nice people from the [Debian Security Team](http://www.debian.org/security/) haven't updated their distribution until yet - but the [number of 57 bug fixes](http://www.debian.org/News/2009/20090627) (as the press release states) is just another sign that - yes - open-source also software has security issues. But at least they (a) tell you about it and evenly important (b) they do fix issues in a very strict time frame.

An especially nice point is that if you incorporate the [upgrades from security.debian.org](http://www.debian.org/security/) in your sources list on a regular basis you won't even have to download vast amounts of data since the majority of the security upgrades should already be fixed for you._
