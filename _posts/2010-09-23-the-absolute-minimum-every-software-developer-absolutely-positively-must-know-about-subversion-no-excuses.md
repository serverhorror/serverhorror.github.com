<p>I was going to write about how to use subversion. Wile preparing the post I wanted to show some nice graphics. Tried to use the official subversion repo as a source. Failed miserably (in terms of getting bored because it's so damn slow and various tools choked on the repository) so here's the real information:</p>
<p><strong>Use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> (or at least <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">some</a> <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/">other</a> DVCS).</strong></p>
