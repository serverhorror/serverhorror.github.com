SourceForge.net opened the [votes for the Community Choice Awards](http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/). You can [vote for Nagios (direct voting)](http://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/?f=485), but not for [Icinga](http://www.icinga.org). Too bad, especially as Nagios is a well established project and [Icinga being rather new](http://www.icinga.org/why-a-fork/) could need some attention.

I couldn't find Icinga in the list, if you now the link to vote for Icinga I'd be happy about it, just drop a comment (if anybody is indeed reading this blog).
