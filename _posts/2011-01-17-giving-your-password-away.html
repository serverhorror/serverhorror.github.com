<p>Thank you dear <a href="http://www.upc.at">UPC</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Me</strong>: I need $INFORMATION for my account, my customer id is....</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong>: Ah...yeah...well. To give you that information <em>you need to tell me your customer password</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: <em>Errr what? How am I sure you aren't misusing it after I give it to you?</em></p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong>: Oh, don't worry. I can't actually see the password. I have a<em> programm that only verifies wether the password you tell me is the same that is stored in our system. So I never actually know the password.</em></p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: *facepalm*....you need my password!?</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong>: Yes, as I told you I will never know your password I can only compare wether it's correct or not.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: If I tell you the password you know it right?</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong>: well, no...yes...To give you the information you requested I need your customer password!</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: *sigh* ....</p></blockquote>
<p>I finally gave up. I changed my password in the web interface, told the guy this password, and then changed it again. <strong>This is so wrong on so many levels.</strong></p>
