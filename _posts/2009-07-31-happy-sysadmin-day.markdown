Today is [**System Administrator Appreciation Day**](http://www.sysadminday.com/).

Be nice to your friendly SysAdmin neighborhood, we work all year hard to give you good service and help you solve problems. We might seem grumpy at times but take that with a sense of humor, after all we are the ones who have to get up at 0300h AM to fix the servers.

BTW: **System Administrators aren't mainly there to fix things, we are here to make sure things don't break**
