<p><a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/users/simonw">simonw</a> over at <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/">debian-administration.org</a> seems to have a <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/users/simonw/weblog/290">problem with SSH Auth on busy servers</a>. I've had a few hosts out in the wild with ssh on port 22 and was suffering similiar problems.</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host</pre>
<p>My solution was to have these options in <span style="white-space:pre;font-family:sans;">sshd_config</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>AllowGroups: <span style="white-space:pre;font-family:sans;">AllowGroups sshusers</span></li>
<li>MaxStartups: <span style="white-space:pre;font-family:sans;">MaxStartups 5:90:10</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These 2 options solved the problems for me. On a busy host you might want to look at the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&amp;sektion=5"><span style="white-space:pre;font-family:sans;">sshd_config</span> manpage.</a></p>
<p>Another helpful options is: <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&amp;sektion=5"><span style="white-space:pre;font-family:sans;">ControlMaster</span> from the <span style="white-space:pre;font-family:sans;">ssh_config</span> manpade</a></p>
<p>What this does it that for a given hostname and username combination it reuses the connection so that on subsequent logins you can login without entering the passwort and in most cases almost immediately as sshd doesn't need to run another process since it reuses the one already existing.</p>
