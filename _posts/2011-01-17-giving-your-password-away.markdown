Thank you dear [UPC](http://www.upc.at)...


> **Me**: I need $INFORMATION for my account, my customer id is....

**Customer Service**: Ah...yeah...well. To give you that information _you need to tell me your customer password_.

**Me**: _Errr what? How am I sure you aren't misusing it after I give it to you?_

**Customer Service**: Oh, don't worry. I can't actually see the password. I have a_ programm that only verifies wether the password you tell me is the same that is stored in our system. So I never actually know the password._

**Me**: *facepalm*....you need my password!?

**Customer Service**: Yes, as I told you I will never know your password I can only compare wether it's correct or not.

**Me**: If I tell you the password you know it right?

**Customer Service**: well, no...yes...To give you the information you requested I need your customer password!

**Me**: *sigh* ....


I finally gave up. I changed my password in the web interface, told the guy this password, and then changed it again. **This is so wrong on so many levels.**
