<p>As said before: <a title="Running a TOR exitÂ node" href="http://blog.serverhorror.com/2011/02/28/running-a-tor-exit-node/">I run a TOR exit node</a>.</p>
<p>What's nice is that this gives me a box to play (privately) that has quite some traffic. Since I didn't use it before anyway and cancelled the server already - don't worry I intend to run it for the next couple of months so that I'll get a feeling for that - I figured it might be a nice thing to do for other people.</p>
<p>Anyway I started "monitoring" the traffic with vnstat. Here's the first day:</p>
<pre><code># vnstat -i eth0

   eth0 since 02/28/11

          rx:  191.93 GiB      tx:  205.07 GiB      total:  397.00 GiB

   monthly
                     rx      |     tx      |    total    |   avg. rate

<p>Times are in UTC and I started on 02/28/11 ~11:30 with the monitoring. That was at a point where virtually no TOR traffic was coming in due to the low uptime of the TOR daemon.</p>
<p>My colocation says I used 30GB of outgoing traffic so that might be in line - with a little bit of fantasy applied :)</p>
