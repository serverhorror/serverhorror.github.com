Today I got myself a cheap printer.

It's a Lexmark INTERPRET s405. I was looking for the following things:



	
  1. Wireless Printing

	
  2. Wireless Scanning

	
  3. Optionally Wireless Fax

	
  4. Cheap


The thing was EUR 99,--. That's probably the lower end of multi-function devices - price wise. But I don't see a reason why I can't just enter the ESSID and password from my wireless LAN to set it up. Instead I had to use this:

> Dear people from Lexmark!

Please, please, please, just let me enter my ESSID and Password directly at the printer. Wouldn't that be so much easier? Wouldn't that save you a ton of money in the long run? You wouldn't have to add an USB cable to every printer.

Best regards,

A Customer
