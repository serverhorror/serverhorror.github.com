<p>No I'm not going to advertise that <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> can only get better because <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a> bought it and now has in turn been bought by <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>.</p>
<p>It is true that MySQL can only get better but the reasons for this are that there for example is:</p>
<ul>
<li>no way to do a consistent backup</li>
<li>schema changes aren't transactional</li>
<li>it doesn't scale very well</li>
</ul>
<p>There couldn't be a better time for <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>. It's completely community driven (released under a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence">BSD-License</a>). That means</p>
<ul>
<li>YOU are defining which features get into it at which don't.</li>
<li>it can't be bought by a company that suddenly shuts it down</li>
<li>If you want to you can patch <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> to your liking and don't give away the source code (not necessarily a good thing, but you have the freedom to do so)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair MySQL couldn't be shut down down either, but Oracle could just stop releasing a database that is called MySQL and all of a sudden you may find yourself in the situation that you have to choose between PerconaSQL or whatnot.</p>
<p>Not so with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>. You get <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> which is IMHO superior to all other Open-Source Databases out there, in fact I think it's actually the only Open-Source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">RDBMS</a> system left.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">Go get PostgreSQL!</a></p>
