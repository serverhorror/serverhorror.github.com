<p>This is a thing that annoys me. Backups should just work, the things I found work best are <a href="http://www.bacula.org/">Bacula</a> and <a href="http://www.amanda.org/">amanda</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/">Bacula </a>needs quite a setup (database, director and storage -- which you still can install on a single machine), it is indeed easier for me to use than <a href="http://www.amanda.org/">amanda</a> for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amanda.org/">amanda</a> does work once it's set up but I my personal opinion is that it should be a real daemon and not "<span style="font-style:italic;">just a cron job</span>". <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/">Bacula</a> runs as a true daemon and can decide when it's best to backup a client. So my suggestion goes for <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/">Bacula</a>.</p>
