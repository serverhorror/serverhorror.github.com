I just checked my Google Reader's starred items and found I have roughly 180 posts starred. Usually I do this when I have the feeling of (multiple choices possible):



	
  * I should try that (as in invest 2-3 hours)

	
  * Seems wrong

	
  * Great stuff, interesting topic to investigate (as in a couple of days - weeks)


Even if I would indeed write about one item per day I'm full for half a year. I wonder if somebody already coined "blog bankrupcy".
