<p>The <a href="http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.31-rc1-git1.bz2">Linux Kernel 2.6.31-rc1 (direct git-snapshot download)</a> has been released.</p>
<p>Among some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-setting">Kernel Mode Setting (KMS)</a> enhancements which allow the Kernel to set the "correct" video mode - and thus take some work from X. The most notable change is probably a change in the on-disk format of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">btrfs file system</a>.</p>
<p>Migration (hopefully) happens automagically upon the filesystem being mounted with the new kernel, there's however no (easy) way back. So <strong>you won't be able to mount the filesystem again with older kernels</strong>.</p>
