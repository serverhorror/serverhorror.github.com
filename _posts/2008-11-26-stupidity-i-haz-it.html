<p>Yes <em>ekimus</em> is my nickname in that case...<code><br />
<strong><em>14:11:53</em> &lt;ekimus&gt;</strong> hmm i have this: "[(elem1, elem2), (elem3, elem4), ...]" what I'd like would be to make that a dictionairy where the first element of each tuple becomes the key and the second element the value. any easy magic that does something like that?<br />
<strong><em>14:12:36</em> &lt;eggy_&gt;</strong> ekimus: dict(L)<br />
