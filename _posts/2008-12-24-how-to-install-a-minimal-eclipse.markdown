Everytime I go to the [Eclipse Homepage](http://www.eclipse.org/) i find myself searching for the right download. Usually I just want the plain Eclipse. That means:



	
  * I don't want any development environment

	
  * I want the download to be as fast as possible (in terms of size)

	
  * I want to find it fast


Usually I manage to accomplish neither of those. So here's what you need to download to get a plain Eclipse as small as possible but still be able to run it.

	
  1. go to the [Eclipse Homepage](http://www.eclipse.org/)

	
  2. find the [download section](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

	
  3. scroll to the bottom of the page

	
  4. click "[Other downloads](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/)"

	
  5. click on the link in the second column of "Latest Release"

	
  6. get the "Platform Runtime Binary" download (it should be about 40 - 50 MB)

	
  7. Consider yourself happy you just needed a _6 step how-to_ to find a plain Eclipse version without any plugins.


Now what can you do with the a plain eclipse that seems to have no usefull functions?

	
  * Get the "[Apache Directory Studio](http://directory.apache.org/studio/)" (which I consider the best freely - as in beer, and software - available LDAP browser)

	
  * Get the "[BPMN Plugin](http://www.eclipse.org/bpmn/)" a great tool to formally specify processes, usefull for all kind of process not just "business"

	
  * Try "[PyDev](http://pydev.sourceforge.net/)" - a great IDE for Python that is just a plugin to Eclipse


Happy Holidays to whom it may concern.
