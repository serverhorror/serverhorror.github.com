<p>It <a href="http://www.icinga.org/team/">seems the people who forked Nagios</a> are making progress fast. The <a href="http://www.icinga.org/2009/05/20/icinga-v080-is-out/">initial 0.8.0 release of Icinga</a> wasn't too long ago and already <a href="http://www.icinga.org/2009/06/17/icinga-081-released/">Icinga 0.8.1 has been released</a>. I hope they keep up the good work and prepackaged binaries for the larger distributions will show up fairly soon.</p>
