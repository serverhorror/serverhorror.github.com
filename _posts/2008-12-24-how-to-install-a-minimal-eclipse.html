<p>Everytime I go to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Homepage</a> i find myself searching for the right download. Usually I just want the plain Eclipse. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't want any development environment</li>
<li>I want the download to be as fast as possible (in terms of size)</li>
<li>I want to find it fast</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually I manage to accomplish neither of those. So here's what you need to download to get a plain Eclipse as small as possible but still be able to run it.</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Homepage</a></li>
<li>find the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">download section</a></li>
<li>scroll to the bottom of the page</li>
<li>click "<a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">Other downloads</a>"</li>
<li>click on the link in the second column of "Latest Release"</li>
<li>get the "<span style="font-style:italic;">Platform Runtime Binary</span>" download (it should be about 40 - 50 MB)</li>
<li>Consider yourself happy you just needed a <em>6 step how-to</em> to find a plain Eclipse version without any plugins.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now what can you do with the a plain eclipse that seems to have no usefull functions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the "<a href="http://directory.apache.org/studio/">Apache Directory Studio</a>" (which I consider the best freely - as in beer, and software - available LDAP browser)</li>
<li>Get the "<a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://www.eclipse.org/bpmn/">BPMN Plugin</a>" a great tool to formally specify processes, usefull for all kind of process not just "business"</li>
<li>Try "<a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/">PyDev</a>" - a great IDE for Python that is just a plugin to Eclipse</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Holidays to whom it may concern.</p>
