<p>People often write to me for advice about submitting a resume to Google. They<br />
always want to know what system administration is like here. I tend to write<br />
something original each time, but I always say the same thing. Therefore, I'm<br />
going to post it here and refer people to this post in the future.</p>
<p>What is system administration like at Google?</p>
<p>System administration at Google is quite different than at most companies.<br />
Since we do all our computing on massive clusters we don't touch much hardware.<br />
It is set up a rack at a time for us in data centers around the world. We don't<br />
spend a lot of time setting up typical services like LDAP, Kerberos, and load<br />
balancers because we have those things set up already, automated, and scaled.</p>
<p>So what /do/ we do? We keep the various web sites of google running, or keep<br />
the systems that they rely on running. We have small teams for each product.<br />
Members usually have 1 week of "on call" (pager) duty out of 6, and the other 5<br />
weeks are spent making improvements to make the on call portion more optimized,<br />
automated, and trouble-free. (Some groups are 1 out of 8, or 3.5 days out of<br />
every 12, or whatever... some have zillions of pages per day, others 1 or two<br />
per week).</p>
<p>When you aren't on duty, you are optimizing the system for better operational<br />
efficiency. Suppose the last time you were oncall you noticed a certain problem<br />
was happening a lot. You might take on a project to monitor all aspects of it,<br />
find the problem, and either fix it or work with the developers to fix it. We<br />
have large, complicated systems that requires deep Unix knowledge to maintain<br />
properly.</p>
<p>A senior person takes on projects that have even larger impact. So, maybe you<br />
notice that not only does your product have that particular problem, but other<br />
projects do too. So you invent a new system that fixes the problem globally.<br />
For example, rolling out software to thousands of machines is difficult. After<br />
each upgrade the machine must be tested to make sure the software is working,<br />
and begin rolling back the change if there are failures. We haven't done that<br />
kind of thing manually in years, but maybe the current system can't tell the<br />
difference between a bug that means you should roll-back all systems, or a<br />
hardware failure that means one particular machine is down. You might refactor<br />
the system so that the failure test is a plug-in module and now everyone can<br />
write their own plug-ins.</p>
<p>This is why we call ourselves "Site Reliability Engineers" instead of of<br />
Sysadmins. As a SRE, we are constantly optimizing the system. Some of us are<br />
more focused on operational aspects (sysadmin skills) and others are focused on<br />
writing tools (software engineering focused). However, we all do some kind of<br />
software development, scripting, and so on. At our scale it isn't a question of<br />
whether or not to automate, but how to automate.</p>
<p>We also have more traditional system administrators in our CorpEng group. They<br />
are focused on internal systems (the printing system, deploying the newest Mac<br />
OS release, etc.). This is also the group that employs our internal helpdesk.<br />
Supporting 20k employees is a big job. Most companies don't have 10,000+ linux<br />
desktops and 15,000+ Mac laptops, plus countless other systems.</p>
<p>A few more great things about working here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The relationship with the developers is collaborative.</li>
<li>You can stay technical while going up the career ladder without having to move into management.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>My co-workers are so smart, I usually feel pretty stupid.</li>
<li>The challenges are so huge, I think we're 2-10 years ahead of the industry. Working here is like having a crystal ball that lets you see the future of our industry</li>
</ul>
