Yes this is (still) ugly. It'll probably stay that way. If you feel bored
and would like to develop a theme for me feel free to do that! <em>:)</em>

<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
    <time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" pubdate>{{ post.date | date: "%F" }}</time>
    &rArr;
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
