<p>There's not much to say about this blog or me. I'm a <a title="System Administrator [wikipedia.org]" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Administrator">System Administrator </a>at a <a href="http://www.inqnet.at/">local company in Vienna</a>. I maintain some  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_systems#Free.2FOpen_source_Unix-like">of this stuff</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">this</a> the latter of which isn't exactly my favourite. Most of the work is done on <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> Servers.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing I'm the head of 5 people - including myself and we maintain about a hundred hardware boxes and about 300 virtual servers. Most of which are<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ">OpenVZ</a> instances with a small number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESX">VMware ESX</a> Servers (2 physical, about 10 Virtual).</p>
<p>We stumble over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administration#Duties_of_a_system_administrator">couple of problems or requirements each day</a> that need to be dealt with. A lot of them are trivial to fix but there are also quite a few which require deeper inspection.</p>
<p>All of us are looking forward to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day">System Administrator Appreciation Day</a> - unfortunately nobody else seems to care about that day :)</p>
