<p>Haha! Freedom!</p>
<p>As of December I'm no longer employed at <a href="http://wwww.inqnet.at">INQNET GmbH</a>. It was a great time there but it was time for me to leave. I had an itch to scratch and wanted to see larger environments. It's a great place to work, friendly  co-workers (hey, even friendly bosses)! They do a lot of bleeding edge tech-stuff for the web, so if you're at least awesome you may want to drop them a note and look for jobs there :)</p>
<p>For me I'll be spending some time with my son and then look for something new. Hopefully it won't take too long since I don't want to run out of money before I run out of life...</p>
